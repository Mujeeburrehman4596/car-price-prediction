# Car Price Prediction Model

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to predict car prices based on key features such as mileage and age. The dataset contains various car details, including mileage, age, and their corresponding selling prices. The model uses logistic regression to categorize car prices into different price ranges (Low, Medium, High, Very High).

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and selecting relevant features for model training.
- **Model Training**: A logistic regression model trained on the dataset to predict car prices.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Various plots, including confusion matrix and classification reports, to visualize the model's performance.

## Files:
- `carprice.csv`: The dataset used for model training and evaluation.
- `car_price_model.py`: Python script for training the logistic regression model and evaluating its performance.
- `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and using the project.

## Requirements:
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
